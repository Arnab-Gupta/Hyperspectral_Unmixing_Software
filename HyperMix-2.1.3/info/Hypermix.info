  The research group "Hyperspectral Computing" (HyperComp) has developed a free tool for distribution and validation of hyperspectral analysis algorithms capable of solving the mixing problem in such images. The tool includes the source code of several algorithms that integrate a full spectral unmixing chain as well as a database of synthetic and real images which validate the algorithms available in the tool. 

  Algorithms were developed by several authors whom belong or belonged to the group.
